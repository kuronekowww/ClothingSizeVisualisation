        I think brandy Melville has cute clothing but it is only one size fits all it can hurt someone if they come and it is way to small that can make a girl really hurt inside and she will start trying becoming smaller and unhealthy it makes girls think she is fat because all her friends are wearing it I donâ€™t think it is fair for brandy Melville to have one size because a 10 year old can fit into it
